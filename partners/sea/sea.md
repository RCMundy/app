### Activated Carbon from Lignin

[A 2016 study](http://wcponline.com/2016/06/15/lignin-waste-transformed-coconut-like-activated-carbon/) found that lignin provides a coconut-like activated carbon  structure that is two to three times more valuable than activated carbon from wood. Like coconut, lignin has tighter graphitic platelet spacings to remove more small molecules from drinking water. Activated carbon from lignin is softer than from coconut shells, which allows it to be used as a powder for faster absorption of contaminants, with less water-leaching ash than present powdered activated carbons.  


Step 1: Produce char at low-temperature (240째 to 310째C).  
Step 2: Activate with 800째 to 950째C 15-psi steam to add pores.
